        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

     <P>CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a rather simple reason. HTML element was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the web page.

        Tags like <font> were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of trouble for web developers. Due to the fact that web pages have different fonts, colored backgrounds, and multiple styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.
        
        CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn’t want to look at a web page that features only HTML elements as it would look completely bare-boned.

        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

        <h1 id="JAVASCRIPT">JAVASCRIPT</h1>
        <P>Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.

            Prerequisites:	A basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
            Objective:	To gain familiarity with what JavaScript is, what it can do, and how it fits into a website.
            A high-level definition
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
            
            The three layers of standard web technologies; HTML, CSS and JavaScript
            HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
            CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
            The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a button as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:
            
            HTML
            Play
            Copy to Clipboard
            <button type="button">Player 1: Chris</button>
            Button showing Player 1: Chris with no styling
            Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:
            
            CSS
            Play
            Copy to Clipboard
            button {
              font-family: "helvetica neue", helvetica, sans-serif;
              letter-spacing: 1px;
              text-transform: uppercase;
              border: 2px solid rgb(200 200 0 / 60%);
              background-color: rgb(0 217 217 / 60%);
              color: rgb(100 0 0 / 100%);
              box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(0 0 200 / 40%);
              border-radius: 10px;
              padding: 3px 10px;
              cursor: pointer;
            }
            Button showing Player 1: Chris with styling
            And</P>
